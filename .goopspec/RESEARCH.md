## 4) Skill File Baseline (`skills/*.md`)

| Skill file | Chars | Est. Tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| `skills/README.md` | 8,249 | 2,062.25 |
| **Skills Total** | **8,249** | **2,062.25** |

---

## 5) Auto-Injected Content Baseline

### Agent factory (`src/agents/agent-factory.ts`)

Measured sections injected into every composed agent prompt:

| Section | Chars | Est. Tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| `#question-tool-instructions-section` | 1,393 | 348.25 |
| `#memory-instructions-section` | 773 | 193.25 |

### System transform (`src/hooks/system-transform.ts`)

Measured runtime-injected templates/blocks:

| Section | Chars | Est. Tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| `#persistent-memory-context-block` | 298 | 74.50 |
| `#session-context-template` | 234 | 58.50 |
| `#session-context-wrapper` | 37 | 9.25 |
| **Auto-Injected Total** | **2,735** | **683.75** |

---

## Notes and Caveats

1. `references/*.md` currently contains **36** files (not 35).
2. `skills/*.md` currently contains **1** markdown file (`skills/README.md`).
3. `slashcommand` uses a dynamic getter for description; measured from the template literal inside `buildDescription()`.
4. `system-transform.ts` does not contain a literal `<goopspec_context>` block in current code; measured actual injected sections present in this file.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce this Baseline audit, rerun file-size and string-literal extraction with the same rules:

- Tool descriptions: extract only `description` literals/templates from each `src/tools/*/index.ts` tool definition.
- Agents/references/skills: raw file character count.
- Auto-injected sections: explicit injected template blocks in `src/agents/agent-factory.ts` and `src/hooks/system-transform.ts`.

# RESEARCH: Plugin Architecture (Wave 1, Task 1.2)

**Domain:** OpenCode plugin + tool + agent architecture (selective tool loading)
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Sources:** OpenCode official docs, OpenCode OSS source (sst/opencode @ 4086a9ae), GoopSpec source

## A2 Answer

**Assumption A2 ("OpenCode loads all tool definitions on launch"): VALIDATED.**

OpenCode constructs the LLM `tools` object by iterating over the full tool registry (built-ins + plugins + MCP) and passes those tool definitions into the provider call. Agent/session permissions are enforced at execution time via `PermissionNext.ask()`, but they do **not** filter which tool definitions are included in the model request.

**Therefore:** OpenCode does **not** support selective tool *definition* loading per agent (as a context-size optimization) without upstream changes.

## Tool Registration Flow (Plugin → OpenCode → LLM)

### 1) Plugin tools are declared in the SDK as { description, args, execute }

Evidence:
- `@opencode-ai/plugin` tool helper + ToolDefinition shape: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/plugin/src/tool.ts

### 2) OpenCode loads plugin hooks and converts ToolDefinition → Tool.Info

Tool definitions from plugin hooks are collected by `Plugin.list()`, and each tool is converted via `fromPlugin()`.

Evidence:
- Plugin loading + `Plugin.list()`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/opencode/src/plugin/index.ts
- Tool registry ingestion + `fromPlugin()`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/opencode/src/tool/registry.ts

### 3) OpenCode passes tool definitions to the LLM every prompt iteration

`SessionPrompt.resolveTools()` builds a Vercel AI SDK `tools` object by looping all tools returned by `ToolRegistry.tools(...)` and registering each one with `ai.tool({ id, description, inputSchema, execute })`. This `tools` object is passed into the model call (`processor.process(...)`).

Evidence:
- `resolveTools()` implementation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts

## How Tool Descriptions/Schemas Reach the LLM

At OpenCode layer, each tool definition sent to the model consists of:
- `description: item.description`
- `inputSchema`: JSON Schema derived from the tool's Zod schema (`z.toJSONSchema(item.parameters)`), then normalized by `ProviderTransform.schema(...)`, then wrapped with `ai.jsonSchema(...)`.

Evidence:
- Tool schema + description wiring: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts
- Provider schema normalization rules: https://deepwiki.com/sst/opencode/4.3-provider-transformations

## Agent Prompt Assembly (GoopSpec)

GoopSpec assembles each agent prompt at config time by concatenating:
- agent markdown body
- injected skills (`skills/`)
- injected references/templates (`references/`, `templates/`)
- memory boilerplate (if enabled)
- question tool boilerplate (always)

Evidence:
- Prompt composition + tool permission mapping: `src/agents/agent-factory.ts`
- Agent registration via config hook: `src/plugin-handlers/config-handler.ts`

## Optimization Opportunities

### Plugin-level (available now)

- Compress tool `description` strings (these are always shipped to the LLM via tool definitions).
- If allowed by spec later: shrink/normalize `args` schemas (JSON Schema also contributes to tool payload).
- Reduce agent prompt size by changing GoopSpec prompt composition (skills/references/boilerplate injection).
- Reduce runtime system prompt injection via `experimental.chat.system.transform` (already used by GoopSpec).

### Requires OpenCode upstream change

- Implement permission-based filtering of the tool list before building the LLM `tools` object in `resolveTools()`. Today, OpenCode always registers every tool returned from `ToolRegistry.tools(...)` into the model request.

Evidence:
- No tool-list filtering in `resolveTools()`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts

## Constraints / Gaps

- `.references/` directory does not exist in this repo.
- `node_modules/` is not present in this worktree, so SDK/source evidence was obtained from upstream OSS source instead.
- The plugin hook surface does not include a hook to modify/filter the `tools` object passed to the LLM (hooks cover message/system transforms, params/headers, and tool lifecycle, but not tool list selection).

Evidence:
- Hooks surface: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/4086a9ae/packages/plugin/src/index.ts

# RESEARCH: Optimization Strategy (Wave 1, Task 1.3)

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Goal:** Prioritize optimization work for Waves 2-4 using composed prompt impact (not raw file size alone).

## Current Composed Prompt Sizes (Top 3 Agents)

Method: `composeAgentPrompt()` output size estimate = `chars / 4`.

| Agent | Composed Chars | Est. Tokens | Skills Injected | References Injected |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `goop-orchestrator` | 136,648 | 34,162.00 | 5 | 12 |
| `goop-planner` | 112,802 | 28,200.50 | 5 | 11 |
| `goop-executor` | 103,568 | 25,892.00 | 5 | 9 |

Key read: the largest agents are already in the 26K-34K range each after composition, and reference/skill injection dominates more than raw base agent markdown.

## Worth-It Threshold

**Success threshold:** minimum **20% reduction** in overall launch overhead baseline.

- Baseline total: `100,213.50` estimated tokens.
- Threshold savings target: **>= 20,042.70 tokens**.
- Stretch target: **25-30%** if high-frequency injected references/skills can be compressed without behavior drift.

Rationale: below 20%, optimization risk (quality regression + maintenance complexity) likely outweighs practical context-window gains.

## Prioritized Optimization Targets (Impact vs Effort)

Ranking uses:
1) composed prompt impact on largest agents,
2) number of agents affected,
3) implementation effort/risk.

### P1 - Agent Prompt Composition (GO)

**Estimated impact:** Very High (primary driver for top 3 agents)  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Why first:** Directly reduces every high-cost composed prompt by trimming verbose base prompt sections and redundant guidance.

Approach:
- Compress the 13 agent markdown bodies, starting with orchestrator/planner/executor.
- Preserve behavioral instructions, gates, and role boundaries; remove duplication/redundant examples first.
- Keep structure stable to protect test and behavior compatibility.

Risks:
- Loss of role fidelity if imperative constraints are over-trimmed.
- Mitigation: per-agent before/after diff review + role behavior verification in Wave 3.3.

### P2 - Injected References (Injected-Only First) (GO)

**Estimated impact:** Very High (largest shared payload in composed prompts)  
**Effort:** Medium-High  
**Why second:** Repeatedly injected references multiply cost across many agents.

Approach:
- Prioritize references by `size x injection frequency`.
- Compress references that are actually injected in frontmatter first (not all 36 blindly).
- De-duplicate overlapping protocol content across heavily used references while preserving canonical instructions.

Risks:
- Protocol drift/inconsistency if overlapping docs diverge.
- Mitigation: maintain one canonical statement for each critical protocol (XML envelope, handoff, deviation rules), then cross-reference.

### P3 - Shared Skills (GO, targeted)

**Estimated impact:** High (shared across major agents, especially `goop-core`)  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Why third:** Skills are injected into many agents; trimming common skills has broad payoff.

Approach:
- Compress high-frequency shared skills first (`goop-core`, `memory-usage` where injected).
- Remove repeated explanatory prose that agents already receive in base prompts/references.
- Keep actionable checklists and constraints intact.

Risks:
- Losing workflow sequencing clarity.
- Mitigation: keep phase contracts and gate language verbatim; trim narrative, not rules.

### P4 - Auto-Injected Boilerplate (Conditional + Compression) (GO)

**Estimated impact:** Medium (small per-agent, broad fan-out to all agents)  
**Effort:** Low-Medium  
**Why fourth:** Memory/question sections are small individually but guaranteed overhead everywhere.

Approach:
- Shorten memory and question boilerplate language without changing required behavior.
- Add conditional injection where safe (memory section only when memory enabled/needed; question section only for agents that may ask user-facing questions).

Risks:
- Agents forget to use required interaction pattern.
- Mitigation: keep a concise mandatory rule line even in compressed form; validate with agent behavior tests.

### P5 - Tool Descriptions (GO, conservative)

**Estimated impact:** Low (~1% baseline) but global  
**Effort:** Low  
**Why still do it:** Easy win and universally applied, but should not consume disproportionate effort.

Approach:
- Conservative compression only (remove redundancy, keep action and constraints).
- Do not change tool schemas or behavior semantics.
- Treat as cleanup/efficiency pass rather than main savings driver.

Risks:
- Tool misuse if descriptions become ambiguous.
- Mitigation: enforce clarity floor and verify tool-selection behavior.

## Go / No-Go Matrix by Category

| Category | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tools | **GO (Conservative)** | Low impact but low risk and global; quick pass only. |
| Agents | **GO (Aggressive but safe)** | Highest direct leverage on composed size for biggest agents. |
| References | **GO (Injected-first)** | Largest repeated payload; prioritize by frequency x size. |
| Auto-injected | **GO (Conditional + concise)** | Small per-agent, large aggregate fan-out; low-medium effort. |

## Wave 2-4 Execution Guidance

- **Wave 2 (Tools):** Keep scope strict and time-boxed; finish quickly unless unexpected regressions.
- **Wave 3 (Agents + Skills):** Primary optimization wave; allocate most review/verification budget here.
- **Wave 4 (References + Auto-injected):** Focus on high-frequency injected references, then conditional injection logic.

## Strategy Risks Summary

| Strategy | Risk Level | Main Failure Mode | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent compression | High | Behavior/role drift | Preserve imperative constraints; role-by-role verification |
| Reference compression | Medium-High | Protocol inconsistency | Canonical source + dedupe with cross-reference |
| Skill compression | Medium | Loss of workflow clarity | Keep phase/gate checklist language intact |
| Auto-injected optimization | Medium | Missing required user interaction behavior | Keep minimal mandatory instruction; test user-facing agents |
| Tool description compression | Low-Medium | Ambiguous tool selection | Keep action verbs + constraints; verify tool behavior |

# RESEARCH: Wave 2 - Tool Description Audit (Task 2.1)

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Scope:** All 16 tool description strings in `src/tools/*/index.ts`, with args schemas reviewed for duplication.
**Methodology:** Reuse Wave 1 token baseline (`chars / 4`) and compare description text against each tool's schema fields (`args` enum/options/descriptions).

## Current Total (Validation)

- **Current tool description total:** `1,010.75` estimated tokens (rounds to `1,011` baseline)
- **Baseline match:** Yes (same 16 tool descriptions from Wave 1)

## Per-Tool Audit

| Tool | Current Tokens | Category | Redundancy / Compression Opportunity | Est. Savings |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| `goop_state` | 214.00 | verbose | Repeats full action enum already in `action` schema; includes safety warning duplicated by agent instructions | 120.00 (56%) |
| `goop_reference` | 180.50 | verbose | Long embedded examples/lists of refs/templates; usage notes repeat `name/type/section/list` schema behavior | 95.00 (53%) |
| `goop_setup` | 96.50 | moderate | Action list duplicates `action` enum; verbose phrasing can become compact one-liners | 24.00 (25%) |
| `memory_save` | 88.75 | moderate | "Use this to..." bullet list overlaps with `type/facts/concepts/sourceFiles/importance` schema guidance | 27.00 (30%) |
| `memory_search` | 82.75 | moderate | Recall examples duplicate `query/types/concepts/minImportance` semantics in schema | 25.00 (30%) |
| `memory_decision` | 64.50 | moderate | Decision-use bullets restate fields (`decision/reasoning/alternatives/impact/concepts`) | 19.00 (29%) |
| `memory_forget` | 60.00 | moderate | Deletion use-cases are verbose; schema already communicates `id/query/confirm` behavior | 18.00 (30%) |
| `memory_note` | 50.50 | moderate | "Simplified memory_save" and usage bullets are redundant; schema already minimal | 15.00 (30%) |
| `goop_delegate` | 34.75 | minimal | Already concise; only minor tightening possible (remove "native task tool invocation" wording) | 2.00 (6%) |
| `goop_skill` | 29.00 | minimal | Clear and short; minor trim only | 2.00 (7%) |
| `goop_adl` | 27.75 | minimal | Slightly verbose sentence; action semantics already in enum | 2.00 (7%) |
| `session_search` | 27.50 | minimal | Already concise and specific; tiny wording cleanup possible | 2.00 (7%) |
| `goop_spec` | 17.25 | minimal | Already compact and descriptive | 0.50 (3%) |
| `goop_checkpoint` | 16.25 | minimal | Already compact and descriptive | 0.50 (3%) |
| `goop_status` | 15.50 | minimal | Already compact and descriptive | 0.50 (3%) |
| `slashcommand` | 5.25 | minimal | Essentially irreducible; dynamic command list built elsewhere | 0.00 (0%) |

## Category Summary

| Category | Tools | Current Tokens | Est. Savings | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| verbose (>40%) | 2 | 394.50 | 215.00 | `goop_state`, `goop_reference` dominate tool-level opportunity |
| moderate (10-40%) | 6 | 442.50 | 128.00 | Primarily memory tools + `goop_setup` |
| minimal (<=10%) | 8 | 173.75 | 9.50 | Keep mostly unchanged; avoid over-optimization |
| **Total** | **16** | **1,010.75** | **352.50** | ~34.9% tool-description reduction potential |

## Compression Recommendations (for Task 2.2)

### Highest-Impact Tools

1. **`goop_state`**: replace 12-line action narrative with a single purpose sentence; rely on `action` enum for action catalog.
2. **`goop_reference`**: remove embedded example lists and usage tutorial language; keep one sentence for references/templates + one for section extraction.
3. **Memory tool cluster** (`memory_save`, `memory_search`, `memory_decision`, `memory_forget`, `memory_note`): compress "when to use" bullets into one short intent line per tool.

### Common Redundancy Patterns Found

- **Schema duplication:** descriptions restate enum options that are already encoded in `tool.schema.enum(...)`.
- **Parameter duplication:** prose explains fields that already have explicit schema `.describe(...)` text.
- **Inline training/examples:** long "Use this to..." and example-heavy guidance can be trimmed because agent prompts already carry usage policy.
- **Low-value verbosity:** many descriptions can be reduced to "what it does" + one critical caveat (if any) without harming tool selection.

### Minimal Description Floor

For each tool, keep:
- primary verb + object (what action it performs),
- one disambiguator if tool family overlaps (for memory tools),
- one safety caveat only when high-risk (`goop_state`, `memory_forget`).

Avoid keeping:
- full action/option catalogs already encoded in schemas,
- long usage examples/anti-patterns,
- guidance duplicated in agent system prompts.

**Scope:** All 13 agent prompt definitions in `agents/*.md`, with injected `skills/*`, `references/*`, and `templates/*` from frontmatter.  
**Methodology:** estimated tokens = `chars / 4`.

Composed prompt formula used (as requested):

`composed_chars = raw_agent_markdown + injected_skills + injected_references + 773 (memory boilerplate) + 1,393 (question tool boilerplate)`

Notes:
- `references:` entries that point to `templates/*` were counted in injected references (same compose chain in `src/agents/agent-factory.ts`).
- This audit uses frontmatter lists and file-size aggregation (not LLM runtime tokenization).

## Shared Boilerplate Overhead

- Per agent boilerplate (fixed):
  - Memory instructions: **773 chars** (193.25 est. tokens)
  - Question tool instructions: **1,393 chars** (348.25 est. tokens)
  - **Total per agent:** **2,166 chars** (541.50 est. tokens)
- Across all 13 agents:
  - **28,158 chars** total (7,039.50 est. tokens)

## Compression Opportunities (Per Agent)

| Agent | Largest Cost Drivers | Specific Opportunities |
|---|---|---|
| `goop-orchestrator` | references (61.4%), skills (20.7%) | Trim high-frequency injected references first (`subagent-protocol`, `plugin-architecture`, `response-format`); split `goop-core` into role/phase slices; collapse repeated XML/handoff prose duplicated across references. |
| `goop-planner` | references (60.4%), skills (23.5%) | Keep planning-critical templates but trim verbose template guidance; reduce overlap between `goop-core`, `workflow-specify`, and phase-gate references; replace long examples with compact checklists. |
| `goop-executor` | references (61.8%), skills (23.9%) | De-duplicate response-format/XML/handoff instructions; compress `atomic-commits` + `git-workflow` overlap; keep only one canonical commit format block. |
| `goop-verifier` | references (57.7%), skills (26.8%) | Merge repeated verification/security instructions between `verification` skill and `security-checklist`; trim duplicated protocol headers and sample envelopes. |
| `goop-researcher` | references (58.0%), skills (23.3%) | Compress research-report formatting examples; slim shared protocol references to concise action rules + one canonical schema link. |
| `goop-writer` | references (64.3%) | Highest reference dominance among top-half agents: consolidate template instructions (`summary`, `retrospective`, `milestone`) and reduce repeated markdown style examples. |
| `goop-debugger` | references (57.7%), skills (25.5%) | Trim overlap between `debugging`, `scientific-method`, and deviation rules; keep one concise experiment loop section. |
| `goop-librarian` | references (57.0%), skills (26.6%) | Reduce duplication between `research` skill and response-format artifacts guidance; shorten repeated handoff/context paragraphs. |
| `goop-tester` | references (58.1%), skills (20.3%) | Compress testing examples (unit/integration/e2e snippets) in injected skills; retain command matrix and quality gates only. |
| `goop-designer` | references (61.5%) | Trim verbose design prose in skills (`ui-design`, `ux-patterns`, `responsive-design`) and rely on compact principles + acceptance checks. |
| `goop-explorer` | references (66.1%) | Highest reference ratio in non-top-3; compress shared protocol references aggressively since agent-specific markdown is already relatively small. |
| `goop-creative` | skills (36.3%), references (46.5%) | Primary lever is skill compression (`goop-core` + `architecture-design`); keep creative constraints but shorten narrative examples. |
| `memory-distiller` | references (72.6%) | No injected skills; largest win is pruning injected references to a minimal memory-distillation protocol subset plus concise XML schema requirements. |

## Key Findings

1. **Injected references dominate every large agent** (typically ~57-66% of composed size).
2. **Cross-agent shared documents are the main multiplier** (`subagent-protocol`, `plugin-architecture`, `response-format`, `xml-response-schema`).
3. **Shared skills also have high fan-out**, especially `goop-core` and `memory-usage`.
4. **Boilerplate is modest per-agent but non-trivial in aggregate** (7,039.50 estimated tokens across 13 agents).
5. **Best Wave 3.2/4.2 compression path:** start with high-impact shared references + shared skills before trimming individual agent markdown.
