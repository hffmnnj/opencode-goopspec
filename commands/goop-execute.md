# /goop-execute

**Start the Execution Phase.** Implement the blueprint using wave-based orchestration.

## Immediate Action

**STOP. Execute this tool call NOW before reading anything else:**
```
goop_reference({ name: "execute-process" })
```

**Then follow the process from that reference.** Do not process user messages until you have loaded and understood the protocol.

## Quick Summary

**Gate:** `specLocked: true` required. Check via `goop_state({ action: "get" })`.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `goop_status` | Check spec lock status and wave progress |
| `goop_state` | **ALL state operations** (NEVER edit state.json directly) |
| `goop_spec` | Load blueprint for execution |
| `goop_checkpoint` | Save state at wave boundaries |
| `goop_delegate` | Spawn executor agents for implementation |
| `goop_adl` | Log deviations during execution |
| `goop_reference` | Load detailed process |

### Process Overview

1. **Gate Check** — Verify `specLocked` and BLUEPRINT.md exist
2. **Load Context** — Read SPEC, BLUEPRINT, CHRONICLE, PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
3. **Wave Loop** — Execute tasks, delegate to goop-executor
4. **Deviation Handling** — Apply rules (auto-fix or checkpoint for decisions)
5. **Wave Completion** — Save checkpoint, generate HANDOFF.md
6. **Execution Complete** — Transition to accept phase

### Deviation Rules

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Rule 1 | Bug found | Auto-fix, document |
| Rule 2 | Missing critical | Auto-add, document |
| Rule 3 | Blocking issue | Auto-fix, document |
| Rule 4 | Architectural | **STOP**, ask user |

## Output

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Source files | Implementation |
| Commits | Atomic changes |
| `.goopspec/CHRONICLE.md` | Progress log |
| `.goopspec/HANDOFF.md` | Session handoff |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Gate check performed (spec_locked)
- [ ] Each task delegated with full context
- [ ] CHRONICLE.md updated after each task
- [ ] Checkpoints saved at wave boundaries
- [ ] HANDOFF.md generated at natural pauses

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:** Skip gate, delegate without context, ignore XML status, skip checkpoints
**DO:** Enforce gate, include PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE, save checkpoints, suggest new sessions
