# Technical Writing Skill

## Purpose
Create clear, accurate, and useful technical documentation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Know Your Audience
- Who will read this?
- What do they already know?
- What do they need to accomplish?

### 2. Be Clear and Concise
- Use simple, direct language
- One idea per sentence
- Avoid jargon unless necessary

### 3. Structure for Scanning
- Use headings and subheadings
- Include bullet points and lists
- Add code examples
- Use tables for comparisons

### 4. Show, Don't Just Tell
- Include working examples
- Add screenshots where helpful
- Provide step-by-step instructions

## Document Types

### Tutorials
Step-by-step learning guides for beginners.

### How-To Guides
Task-oriented guides for specific goals.

### Reference
Comprehensive technical details and API docs.

### Explanations
Background and conceptual information.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Your Instructions** - Follow your own docs
2. **Use Active Voice** - "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
3. **Be Consistent** - Same terms, formatting, style throughout
4. **Update Regularly** - Outdated docs are worse than none
5. **Get Feedback** - Have users test your documentation

- [ ] Accurate and up-to-date?
